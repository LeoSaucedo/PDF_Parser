This is a simple program I wrote that automatically converts PDFs and JPGs to a single, joined PDF file.

### Usage
Right now, you must run the program inside of Visual Studio 2017 in order to change the path where the files are generated. In the very near future, I will implement a way to compile it into a .exe, and package it as a full-fledged app.

If you want to use this code, however, change line 15, the `dirPath` variable, to whatever path you want to place the files in.

Thank you for your visit!

#### Dependencies
- This program uses the PDFSharp dependency. You can download it [here](http://www.pdfsharp.net/Downloads.ashx).
